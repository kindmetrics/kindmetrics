# Why use Kindmetrics as an Google Analytics alternative?
Google Analytics is free; I am sure people will think that. But Google Analytics is not free.

Google Analytics let you see numbers of your data, but you can't see all of it, they have many data about you and your visitors. Google is famous for being a for-profit advertising company. And Ad business is doing one thing: Selling data. Google is selling data as their way to get profit. That's why they don't need your card details, they got other information instead, which they sell or use for targeting ads.

Over 85% of all websites use Google Analytics as tracking. That means Google Analytics can see an overview of 85% of all websites visitors flows and traffic. It is making it a bit scary.

With Kindmetrics, you can trust that it won't use or share your data. It is because Kindmetrics is not an advertising company. It is a software company.

## You will own your web analytics data.
When you use Kindmetrics, you will keep all ownership of 100% of all data for your websites. Kindmetrics will keep privacy for you and your visitors. When you use our service, all your analytics are stored on our servers in the cloud, but you still own it.

1. Your data are stored by a software company and not an advertising company that sells data.
2. Your data is not sent to any third party at all, not even CDNs like others do
3. Kindmetrics do not do any specific calculation or harvesting on your data to play with AI or anything. Only the metrics you see on the dashboard.

Google won't do this. They are an ad-tech company that will use it for a way to gain as much profit as possible.

## Privacy of your visitors and yourself
Privacy is starting to come up as a trend, a shift, of something better than be happening on the internet. Kindmetrics is part of that shift.

Kindmetrics collect so little personal information as possible. The truth is, even if Google seems not to think so, that you don't need personal information to calculate or track visitors on your website. Kindmetrics also don't save any cookies.

If the visitor has DNT (Do Not Track) enabled Kindmetrics also respect their wishes and Kindmetrics won't track them. DNT is something that most analytics services don't do, and visitors won't know if it is appreciated. With Kindmetrics visitor's DNT flag will be acknowledged.

And about Google Analytics, it is the opposite; you are sacrificing your and your visitor's privacy. You can do everything on Kindmetrics without offering your visitors privacy.

Kindmetrics also respect your information and not only your visitors. It tries to minimize that your data is going through third parties and be sure that your data is as protected as your visitors.

## GDPR, CCPA and PECR compliance
The new laws are there to protect your visitors, and of course, you want to be compliant with them. Kindmetrics are compliant with all of them.

When you track or collect personal website usage data, you need to ask for and get explicit consent for the visitor according to the recent regulations like the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) in the EU.

The world has followed the same idea; To protect personal data. Now other regulations have been introduced, such as CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act) in the United States and the PECR (Privacy and Electronic Communication Regulations) in the United Kingdom.

Google Analytics collects many data, and you would need to ask for and get consent and handle that in the right way, which many websites don't do. I would consider Google Analytics as a potential liability if you use it for your site.

Kindmetrics are not using cookies; it anonymizes the visitors. And we are open about who our third parties are, which is a shorter list than many others.

## Small and cute
Kindmetrics is a small company focusing on customers. I am a lonely founder of Kindmetrics, and I only listen to my customers. You could say that the customers drive Kindmetrics future.

Kindmetrics don't want to maximize the profit; I want a stable growth and a place where I can live on Kindmetrics but still have my customers interests in mind. Kindmetrics won't ask for capital or investment. I want to be bootstrapped and focus on giving an excellent service. Kindmetrics won't sell data to be profitable.

Even if Kindmetrics is small, it is already made to handle massive traffic and can scale without issues to handle a lot of new data. It won't slow down either on its site or the tracking file, which you use on your website.


## The lightweight alternative to Google Analytics
Many different options to Google Analytics are showing off about the size of the script they use. Kindmetrics won't do it differently.

Kindmetrics tracking script is around 2KB. With that we get all the data you would like about your visitors, check for DNT and send to our server if DNT is disabled.

Google Analytics size is 45.7 KB, with their tags and analytics together. That takes a lot more traffic and a bit longer to load. And ironically faster sites are rewarded by googles search engines and others for that matter.

It is also simple to install, just a small script tag to add to your HTML head. It will work immediately, and it will load faster than others, and you know that people can be impatient with the page load so they will be happy with a faster page.

## Why is Kindmetrics not free like Google Analytics?
Google Analytics is not free; you are paying with your and your visitor's data. They are an advertisement company. Google became big by selling personal information, which they collect by example, Google Analytics.

Kindmetrics are not selling any data; It is more of a service company. I am selling a service instead of your data. So by paying me a monthly price, you still own your data.

Kindmetrics will always work like that. To always have Kindmetrics's customers interest in mind and focus on their needs.
