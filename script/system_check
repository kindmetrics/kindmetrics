# Use this script to check the system for required tools and process that your app needs.
# A few helper functions are provided to make writing bash a little easier. See the 
# script/helpers/function_helpers file for more examples.
#
# A few examples you might use here:
#   * 'lucky db.verify_connection' to test postgres can be connected
#   * Checking that elasticsearch, redis, or postgres is installed and/or booted
#   * Note: Booting additional processes for things like mail, background jobs, etc...
#     should go in your Procfile.dev.
